Generate a UUID for all requests to Django to be used in logging and error reporting for traceability. 

# Why? 

Why would you want to use this silly little thing? In a containerized, orchestrated, microservice world with centralized logging, it's often hard to figure out where things have gone wrong.  

This middleware adds a UUID to the normal Django request object. You can do things with that UUID like: 

- Add it to all of your log messages
- Add it to your error reports to Sentry/Rollbar/etc.
- Pass it along to other internal services

Along with generating and attaching a UUID to each request, the middleware also automatically adds the UUID to the response headers as `X-Request-ID` so anyone consuming your responses (such as an API) can use that as a reference point for reporting errors back to you. 

# Installation

After installing `django-tracer` via `pip` or `pipenv`, add `tracer` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings. 

Then add `tracer.middleware.RequestID` to the top of your `MIDDLEWARE` settings. 

# Usage with standard logging

```
import logging

from django.http import HttpResponse

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def some_view(request):
    """ simple log example """
    logger.info("Whee!", extra={'request_id': request.id})
    return HttpResponse("example content")
```

## Other ways to use this Request ID

There are several other places you may consider using the ID to improve traceability: 

- Pass it as an argument to any Celery tasks you generate so there is a clear path between the incoming request and the tasks that were generated from it
- Pass it as a header or argument to other internal APIs or services 
- Attach it to a bound [structlog](http://www.structlog.org/) object so it is always included in your log output

# Thanks!
